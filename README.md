#Steps to run the application
1. After cloning the code please use ``mvn clean install`` to build the project
2. Please Use ``mvn spring-boot:run`` to run the application
3. Please use the postman collection to test this applicaton

Note:- This code is work in progress. Due to personal situation I was not able to finish the following tasks
1. Sorting
2. Role based authentication using spring security
3. Dockerization of the application using docker-compose

Concepts used :-
1. Separation of concerns
2. Strategy pattern
3. Builder pattern
